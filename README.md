Title: Demystifying the Complex Racial and Gender Disparities in the Economic Statuses of American Citizens 
 
Abstract:
Racial and gender disparities in income as well as other factors of lifestyle top the list of some of the most visible and persistent issues that American society has been confronted with for decades. Even today we notice that certain sections of the societies like the American Indians and Blacks are more likely to be employed in low-wage paying occupations, have fewer children enrolled in high school or tertiary education, and have unusually high percentages of children incarcerated by race and gender. 
The sources and reasons for this broadening “income gap” have been studied and debated for many years, with explanations ranging from centuries of discriminatory practices, residential segregation, and varying family structures to even genetic differences.
The drawback of most of these studies is the fact that they observe just one generation of candidates from different races. To delve further into the causes and consequences surrounding this “income gap”, I decided to explore the relationships between several factors such as household income, size of families, education, homelessness, marital status, and criminal record across five main races (Aian - American Indian and Alaska Native children, Asian, Black, Hispanic, and White) and 2 genders (male, female). 
I believe this form of comprehensive exploration would aid us in demystifying the complex correlations between economic mobility and race in American Society. It’s a step towards understanding the community we live in and contributing towards facilitating a more diverse and inclusive environment for all races/genders.
