```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, 
                      message = FALSE, 
                      warning = FALSE,
                      comment = NA)
```

**Setting up:**

Load `tidyverse`, which includes `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `tidyr`, and other packages.

```{r echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```

Read in the file, and store its data in a new variable named.

```{r}
economy <- read.csv("table_12.csv", header= TRUE, sep = ",")
```

```{r}
glimpse(economy)
```


```{r}
economy <- na.omit(economy)
```
**Problem Statement: 

```{r}
head(economy)
```



```{r}
economy <- economy %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("count_"), names_to = "race", values_to = "count")


economy %>%
  ggplot(x= race, y = count) + geom_jitter(aes(x= race, y= count, color = race)) + labs(x= "Number of Children born to Parents of Different Races", y = "Parent household income", title = "Parent income versus number of children born of different races.")

```

```{r}

  geom_boxplot(aes(x= race3, y= count_kid_col, fill = race3)) +
  labs(x= "Children of different races in College", y = "Count", title = "Number of children of different races in College.")
